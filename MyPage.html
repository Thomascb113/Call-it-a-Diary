				Did you know that you aren't special? No matter how many people tell you that you are or how confident you are in yourself, if you aren't able to look at yourself and realize that where you are right now is not where you want to be, and that you are not going to get there only thinking highly of yourself, then you will realize that you are not special. You are only blinding yourself with an emotional high. This delusion will only keep you from stiving to get what you want. It will keep you being the person you think you're meant to be. Keep you from your percieved purpose. This entitlement can ruin you. It'll destroy your life as you know it and while everything falls apart you'll feel like you're on cloud nine as long as you believe that someday everything will come to you without trying to fix yourself.<br>

				<br> These are my thoughts after reading one chapter of what is coming to be one of my favorite books <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</i>. I walked through about a third of my life believing that I was destined to be a star in whatever I do. However, I am only now realized that I don't necessarily have the work ethic to be that star. That doesn't mean that I can't develop it, though. <br>

				<br> What I believe to be my own surfering is realy what everyone will go through someday. That is a part of what makes me not special. The fact that everyone will inevitably reach the point of realization rattles my brain even after reading the segement. I have come to realize, however, that maybe I shouldn't worry about how other people are doing. Don't get me wrong, although inevitable, I would never wish for someone to go through the thought process of understanding how mediocre they are. It is a gut renching feeling that can lead to a spiralling madness. It may even make us not want to improve. It can leave us wasting away wondering: <br>

					 <br><q> if I had just realized this earlier, I could have been a much better person. I could have accomplished more, made more friends, had more partners or made more money</q>.<br>

				<br> I know that I've thought some of these. I believed that If maybe I had applied myself a little (<strong>lot</strong>) more when I was in highschool, I could be in one of those top ranking schools in the nation. If I had worked on my craft, I could be hearing back from more internship opportunities. I made it this far in life wondering how great I was going to be without actually putting in the work. That was entitlement.<br>

				<br>From this point onward, I don't want to feel as if I am wasting my time. I want great things to happen to me, but I will no longer imagine this fantasy life. I will work for it, regardless of how strenous the path may be.<br>

				<b>This is not a <q>pick up</q> guide.</b> It couldn't be any further from it. Despite its misleading cover, this it not a book that teaches you how to increase the number of sexual partners you have in your life. It is <em>just</em> a self imrpovement book. I use the word <q>just</q> loosely here because while this book isn't to make your <q>game</q> better, it will consiquently make your interactions with potential partner (<em>assuming one reads and follows the direction</em>). <br>

				<br>This book dives into theme of masculinity, intimacy/vulnerability and shame within the first few chapters of the book. In a world where there is a call for a new form of masculinty, men often shy away from the former two themes because it was once seen as <q>weak</q>. Vulnerability was once something I thought of as absolutely <em>terrifying</em>. The idea of opening one's heart to another person was the equivilant to stripping yourself naked and presenting yourself to a Siberian Tiger. Which, now, makes more sense as to why vulnerabilty is scene as admirable. Presenting yourself to a preditor, although stupid, can be seen as a sign of courage. Showing that you aren't afraid lets others know that you can be counted on.<br>

				<br> Now, should you go to the nearest zoo, strip, and walk up to a tiger? For legal and safety reasons, <b>no</b>. Similarly, should you walk up to every person and spill your guts? Not reccomended. Vulnerability is not a skill, but a state of mind. A state that is only present around people you trust. We likely don't trust everyone we might. In fact, we should't trust everyone we meet. However, we should be able to converse about feeling and emotions with those we do trust. That is what makes vulnerability so rewarding.</br>
